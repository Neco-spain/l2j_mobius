<html><body>Hunter Guild Leader Arcturus:<br>
Hey, are you interested in the Hunter Guild?<br>
I am Arcturus, newly appointed president of the association. My main job is a hunter. I got a bit of a tedious job.<br>
Well, I can't help it. Let's try to revive the Hunters' Guild again.<br>
I just want to get the hunter's guild back to its original shape and go back to a life of full-blown hunting.<br>
